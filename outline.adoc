* *In scope*
** How to build and run services that run on k8s from a dev perspective
** Which tools & tech are worth investing time in
** Best practices & common gotchas

* *Out of scope*
** How to operate or deploy a k8s cluster
** Audience participation - this will be a whistle stop tour
** k8s architecture - just treat it like a black box. We should cover this a little bit at least

* Kubernetes architecture & core concepts from 10,000 feet
** What are
*** pod
*** deployment
*** service
*** *Bit skeptical about including stuff about actual k8s architecture, but we could touch on these components*
*** kubelet
*** kube-proxy
*** api server
*** scheduler
*** controller manager
*** reconciliation

** Great info in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90kZRyPcRZw

* Local development workflow
** http://skaffold.dev/docs[Skaffold] captures much of the workflow most devs need in a single tool
*** It is a good starting point for understanding what a good local dev workflow looks like
*** You might hit limitations - it is not possible yet to use a custom deploy step, for example
** VSCode support
** CLI tools - kubectx, k9s
** Minikube, Docker Desktop

* Visualising the cluster
** Dashboard
** https://github.com/vmware/octant[Octant]
** VScode k8s extension

* Approaches for building images from source
** This means no Dockerfile needs to be created
** In theory this is great because it can lead to much more consistency across app deployment
** Fabric8s maven plugin
** Jib
** buildpacks.io

* Image Tagging Strategies
** Don't use latest ever
** sha, timestamp, version

* Using profiles
** Many tools such as skaffold, kustomize & helm support profiles eg test, dev

* Deployment
** Image registries
**

* Remote build services
** Tekton pipelines

* Automated testing & Kubernetes
** KIND (Kubernetes in Docker)
** Container structure tests

* Debugging apps on Kubernetes
** How to open up ports
** telepresence
** VSCode

* Provisioning a persistent data store with your application
** Brief talk about StatefulSets and PersistentVolumentClaims
** crossplane.io could be a better solution in many cases

* Packaging your service as a Cloud Native Application Bundle
** Useful for releasing a product consisting of an image or into a secure network

* Health monitoring and management of running services

* Log aggregation

* TLS Termination
** Nginx ingress

* Integrating with Kubernetes security

* Externalised Configuration & Secrets
** Spring Cloud k8s support

* Service to Service communication & discovery

* Ingress Controllers

* Observability of applications
